### I programmed a login page that uses a color palette for anyone who is a design lover. Fully responsive website for all screens, which will be used only HTML and CSS, and also for our image that I used in my project was taken from the StorySet website, an animated avg image, which gave the website an up. And for the fonts I used google font.
